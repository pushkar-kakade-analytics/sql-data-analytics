# Window Functions in Business Intelligence

## Overview
Window functions are used extensively in analytics and reporting scenarios where calculations must be performed across a defined set of rows without aggregating the dataset.

## Business Use Cases
- Running totals in financial dashboards
- Ranking customers or projects
- Month-over-month comparisons
- Trend and variance analysis

## Why It Matters
BI dashboards frequently require comparative and cumulative metrics. Window functions enable efficient calculation directly at the database layer.
